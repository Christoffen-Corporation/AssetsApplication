# Thoughts From CEO M. Gage Morgan For This Application

Hello, this is a little bit of a place for documenting my rambling that I feel only people who want to check into this project need to see. I'm a C programmer, and my name is M. Gage Morgan, if you didn't pick that up already. I know people don't generally like the bias that comes with first-person POV, but chill, because I am the original developer of this application. I'm having some cooldown time, and I thought I'd document some of the things I thought might be cool for me to implement. 

## Personal Maintainer Logs

These are pseudo-blog posts, and will be archived as needed as long as this project is continued. Also note that a template will be included. This will be the one I copy and mod. Note that because this is my section personal ramblings as a project maintainer, they will be petrolled by me to make sure no trolling or changing to inaccurate content takes place. 

## TODO List (personal)
I'm not telling anybody, not even Elijah, that this page exists. Not to be a dick, but because if he mentions something he read here and I didn't post to FB or Twitter over this, I know where he's been lmfao. I doubt he'll be here, if not until he has a reason to be here in the first place. 

### August 27, 2016 - Unorganized Thoughts

1. Take UI and put it as an addition to the src/Assets. 
2. Use GCC to compile the entire API folder into its own library. Luckily, even though I didn't know how to do it at the time, shared 
   libraries can easily use the agnostic code found in this folder. 
3. It's time to create bindings! C# will be targeted first, I know how to do it. 
4. This project is an extension of my C learning (Christoffen won't be able to be developed without manpower, and I need to learn  
   skills so I can be productive as well, despite my position within the company. 

The APIs are going to be reworked to include more C functionality in the following by yours truly:

   (a) Using constants. I want to see where all that's coming from. Also, that may solve a future problem when building icons:      
       Different icons come in different sizes, use a constant as a preset. 
   
   (b) The current way things are? No pointers. The program may benefit in flow control from having functions able to be called from 
       a new pointer. As a programmer, I love learning features I think I may need, and this will definitely help.
